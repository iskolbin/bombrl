BombRL
======

A roguelike game about guy who wanders around and dispatch foes with bombs.
Like in [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_(1983_video_game)).
Btw, this idea is already (somehow) implemented in the project
[Bomberogue](http://www.alamak0ta.republika.pl/bomberogue.html).

Build
-----

You need Lua 5.1+ or LuaJit. You need [luabox](https://github.com/iskolbin/luabox)
installed. The simplest way of it is cloning repo and use `luarocks make`.

TODO
----

* WallWalk bonus
* BombWalk bonus
* Bonus bonus
* Detonator bonus
* AsbestosSuit bonus
* Bonus levels
* Lives add (on score maybe)
* Game menu
* Self-contained distro
